Hi, I am Kristof and passionate about soils, particularly wetland soils. Within my studies I employ methods to identify reducing conditions and what drives me is the linkage between redox-driven processes from the microscale üî¨ towards larger scales üåç. Besides educating at the University of Cologne, I will give it a try to blog and highlight what my work is all about. Particularly the programming language R will be a part and which benefits arise to employ it for soil science related studies (section **blog**). In addition, I will give an overview about redox related topics (section **redox**) to spread information my mentor [Tim](https://geographie.uni-koeln.de/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/bodengeographie-bodenkunde/mitarbeiter/mansfeldt-tim) is working on since the 1980s with my contributions from 2011 onward.
