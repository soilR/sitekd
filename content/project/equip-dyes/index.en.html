<p>Redox measurements are valuable to predict the occurrence/likelihood of a reduced species in soil solution, e.g., the presence of ferrous Fe (Fe<sup>2+</sup>). One simple method to infer reducing conditions is the use of dyes, which react with Fe<sup>2+</sup> to colored compounds. Commonly, 2,2’-dipyridyl <a href="https://www.publish.csiro.au/SR/SR9810175">Childs 1981</a> is taken but potassium ferrocyanide <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/bookseries/developments-in-soil-science/vol/22/suppl/C">Ringrose_voase and Humphreys 1993</a> can also be used. Although simple to use, this method provides only a snapshot, and it also uses harmful chemicals.
Childs (1981) proposed using a 0.1% solution of α,α-dipyridyl and the NTCHS a 0.2% solution within 1 M ammonium acetate (Fiedler et al. 2007). The solution can be sprayed or dripped onto the soil of a soil auger or towards the front of a soil profile. Typically, the reaction occurs very fast within seconds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using the dye you should hurry up and do it on a fresh sample since Fe<sup>2+</sup> will auto-oxidize and metal containing auger or steel cylinder might deliver a false positive reaction.</p>
