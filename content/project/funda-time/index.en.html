<p>The following timeline was created with the R package <strong>timevis</strong> ‚åöÔ∏è <a href="https://daattali.com/shiny/timevis-demo/">Link</a>. It offers a huge flexibility since it enables to pan along the timeline, zoom in and zoom out. This summary of the history of redox measurements in soils is based on my own findings and literature I had cited previously. Please give me a note and I will edit the timeline with further findings.
For a better overview, I built groups of the commonly employed methods to characterize the soil redox status:</p>
<ul>
<li>E<sub>H</sub> measurements by redox electrodes<br />
</li>
<li>Dyes that indicate the presence of, e.g., Fe<sup>2+</sup><br />
</li>
<li>IRIS tools (<strong>I</strong>ndicator of <strong>R</strong>eduction <strong>I</strong>n <strong>S</strong>oils) that indicate Mn and Fe reducing conditions by dissolution of synthetic minerals</li>
<li>Others (e.g.)
<ul>
<li>Iron metal rods</li>
<li>Terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs) approach</li>
<li>Oxidative capacity (OXC) approach</li>
<li>‚Ä¶</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The following static timeline (üíØ % <strong>ggplot</strong>) is more general of the most important findings with major breakthroughs:</p>
